# HyperReact, NPM and Webpack

## Overview and prerequisites

In an Isomorphic Ruby world, we need a good way of including Ruby and JavaScript components so they co-exist and play nicely together.

Most Ruby libraries are distributed as Gems whereas (these days) most Javascript components are distributed through NPM. Webpack co-exists well with Rails and the combination of Rails, Yarn, Sprockets and Webpack looks like it might become a standard within the Rails community.

This tutorial will take you through [Setup](#setup) of NPM and Webpack, [Usage](#usage) instructions for adding new components and then give an [Example](#example) of adding a new JavaScript component to a HyperReact project.

This tutorial assumes that NPM is installed. Please see the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/) for installation instructions.

Additionally, this tutorial starts with an existing Rails app with **HyperReact already setup and working**. For more information on how to get to that stage, please see the [HyperReact and Rails Tutorial](http://ruby-hyperloop.io/tutorials/hyperreact_with_rails/).

You can access the [source code]((https://github.com/barriehadfield/tutorial-hyperreact-webpack)) to this tutorial here.

## Setup

If you have completed all the steps above, let's get started - there are a few steps to this process:

+ Adding Webpack to your project
+ Setting up Webpack so that it generates assets for server side pre-rendering and client side rendering
+ Installing React and ReactDOM via NPM
+ Updating the Rails asset pipeline to use the bundles generated by Webpack

### Step 1 - Adding Webpack to your project

Run these three commands:

`npm init` will create an empty package.json in your root folder

`npm install webpack --save-dev` install Webpack and create a node_modules folder

`npm install webpack -g` so we can run Webpack from the command line

The commands above will have created a `package.json` (similar concept to a Gemfile) and a `node_modules` folder containing hundreds of JavaScript dependancies that we do not need in the source of our project so let's tell git to ignore them by adding a `.gitignore` file:

```
#/.gitignore
/node_modules
```

### Step 2 - Setting up Webpack

Now that we have Webpack, we need to add 3 boiler plate files to configure it. As you add more JavaScript packages you will be updating these files. Again this is similar to updating your Gemfile when you add new gems to a project.

Add `webpack.config.js` to the root of your project:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
var path = require("path");

module.exports = {
    context: __dirname,
    entry: {
      client_only:  "./webpack/client_only.js",
      client_and_server: "./webpack/client_and_server.js"
    },
    output: {
      path: path.join(__dirname, 'app', 'assets',   'javascripts', 'webpack'),
      filename: "[name].js",
      publicPath: "/webpack/"
    },
    module: {
      loaders: [
        // add any loaders here
      ]
    },
    resolve: {
      root: path.join(__dirname, '..', 'webpack')
    },
};
```

Then create a folder called webpack and add the following two files:

```javascript
// webpack/client_only.js
// any packages that depend specifically on the DOM go here
// for example the webpack css loader generates code that will break prerendering
console.log('client_only.js loaded');
```

```javascript
// webpack/client_and_server.js
// all other packages that you can run on both server (prerendering) and client go here
// most well behaved packages can be required here
console.log('client_and_server.js loaded')
```

### Step 3 - Installing React and ReactDOM

This step is really simple as we have NPM installed. Just run these two commands:

`npm install react --save` to install React
`npm install react-dom --save` to install ReactDOM

Note how this modifies your 'package.json' and installs React and ReactDOM in your `node_modules` folder.

### Step 4 - Using Webpack to build your client and server bundles

Simply run this command:

`webpack`

You should see a result something like this:

```
Hash: 756a1dc4a11c8fccd0a4
Version: webpack 1.14.0
Time: 55ms
               Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
client_and_server.js  1.61 kB       0  [emitted]  client_and_server
      client_only.js  1.61 kB       1  [emitted]  client_only
   [0] ./webpack/client_and_server.js 214 bytes {0} [built]
   [0] ./webpack/client_only.js 206 bytes {1} [built]```
```
Our `client_and_server.js` and `client_only.js` bundles are built and ready to be included in our application. If you look in your `app/assets/javascripts/webpack` folder you should see the two files there. Note that these bundles are empty at the moment as we have not added any JavaScript components yet. We will do that in Step 6.

### Step 5 - Adding Webpack bundles to the Rails asset pipeline

Finally we need to require these two bundles into our rails asset pipeline.

Edit `app/assets/javascript/application.js` and add

```ruby
//= require 'webpack/client_only'
```

Then edit `app/views/components.rb` and directly after `require 'hyper-react'` add the following two lines:

```ruby
require 'webpack/client_and_server.js'
require 'reactrb/auto-import'
```

### Step 6 - Installing React and ReactDOM

This step is really simple as we have NPM installed. Just run these two commands:

`npm install react --save` to install React
`npm install react-dom --save` to install ReactDOM

Note how this modifies your 'package.json' and installs React and ReactDOM in your `node_modules` folder.

Next we need to `require` them into `client_and_server.js`:

```javascript
// webpack/client_and_server.js
ReactDOM = require('react-dom')
React = require('react')
```

And finally we need to run `webpack` to add them to the bundle:

```
webpack
```

The output should look something like this:

```
Hash: db338e21dcc44f66e5b5
Version: webpack 1.14.0
Time: 737ms
               Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
client_and_server.js   740 kB       0  [emitted]  client_and_server
      client_only.js  1.61 kB       1  [emitted]  client_only
   [0] ./webpack/client_and_server.js 271 bytes {0} [built]
   [0] ./webpack/client_only.js 206 bytes {1} [built]
    + 177 hidden modules
```

Note that `client_and_server.js` has gone from 1.61kB to 740kB as it now includes the source of React and ReactDOM.

## Usage

Now that we have completed the setup, using NPM and Webpack to include new JavaScript components is simply a case of running Step 6 again for each component you would like to add. You simply follow these three steps:

+ Install the component using NPM `npm install xx --save`
+ `require` the component into either `webpack/client_and_server.js ` or `webpack/client_only.js `
+ Run the `webpack` command to rebuild your bundles

## Example

To complete this tutorial, let's install a React component and access it in HyperReact.

We are going to use [Pete Cook’s React rplayr](https://github.com/CookPete/playr) to play a YouTube video.

First let’s install the component via NPM:

```
npm install react-player --save
```

Next we need to `require` it in `webpack/client_and_server.js`

```javascript
// webpack/client_and_server.js
ReactPlayer = require('react-player')
```

Then run `webpack` so it can be bundled

```
webpack
```

And then finally let’s add it to a HyperReact component:

```ruby
def render
  div do
    ReactPlayer(url:  'https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzCsDVfPQqk',
      playing: true
    )
  end
end
```
