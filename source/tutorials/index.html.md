# Hyperloop COMP architecture tutorials

This site contains a number of Tutorials and Quickstarts. The tutorials are arranged in accordance with the architectural aspect they cover, though some are not limited only to that aspect. The Quickstarts are fully working and configured applications you can clone and run.

Keeping the tutorials current is quite a task so please raise any issues you find or better still, issue a pull request against the source branch of the website. All help and contribution is most welcome and valued.

Teaching is a fantastic way to learn, so if you find that a topic is not well covered, please feel free to write a tutorial of your own which we can include here.

## Components

> ##### [Chat-App Tutorial](/tutorials/chat_app)
This tutorial will teach you the basics of building a HyperReact application that **runs purely in your browser** with no need for any back end system (like Rails, Node or Sinatra).
This work-along tutorial is an excellent place to start to learn the HyperReact DSL without needing to learn how to install it. If you have not used the HyperReact DSL before, this tutorial will get you going with minimal setup

> ##### [NPM and Webpack Tutorial](/tutorials/hyperreact_with_webpack)
In an Isomorphic Ruby world, we need a good way of including **Ruby and JavaScript components** so they co-exist and play nicely together.
This tutorial will show you how to setup and use NPM and Webpack with HyperReact.
The source of this tutorial is available as a [Quickstart](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/quickstart) which you can clone.

> ##### [File Uploader Tutorial](/tutorials/file_uploader)
A brief tutorial will show you how to combine Ruby and JavaScript code and take you through the steps to build a Image Uploader using HTML5 FileReader and Hyperloop.

## Operations

> Coming soon. Looking for contributors - could it be you?

## Models

> ##### [HyperReact and Rails Tutorial](/tutorials/hyperreact_with_rails)
A **short tutorial** which will show you how to add HyperReact to a Rails app and render a basic component. All you need to know to get started with HyperReact and Rails.
The source of this tutorial is available as a  [Quickstart](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/quickstart) which you can clone.

# Other Tutorials

> ##### [Hyperloop Showcase Tutorial](https://github.com/fzingg/hyperloop-showcase)

> This is a simple Rails application showcasing HyperReact (a wrapper for the React.js library for creating user interfaces), Opal, NPM, Webpack, React-Bootstrap, HyperMesh (gives your HyperReact components CRUD access to your server-side ActiveRecord models and implements push notifications) and other associated technologies.

> This Showcase application will mix native React and HyperReact components, be styled by Bootstrap CSS (using React-Bootstrap), display a video (using a native React component) and use HyperMesh to handle data for an Events feed app.

> ##### [Frederic ZINGG's Hyperloop/Heroku Tutorial](https://github.com/fzingg/hyperloop-showcase-heroku)

> This tutorial is a very detailed list of commands and files modification to achieve a complete working deployment of the Hyperloop showcase on a HEROKU Server.

> Of course the HEROKU deployment can be faster but this tutorial allows programmers to check step by step where an error could happen.


## Learning Opal

Hyperloop uses Opal to compile Ruby code to ES5 native JavaScript. If you have not used Opal before then you should at a minimum read the excellent guides as they will give you a working understanding of Opal.
