## Further Reading

**Note:** The Hyperloop gems are in a process of being renamed. The links below will take you to the correct Github projects but you might find the name of the project does not quite match the name of the gem on this page. This will be addressed over time as the gems are renamed. HyperReact was previously known as Reactrb.

### HyperReact is powered by React

HyperReact and friends are in most cases simple DSL Ruby wrappers to the underlying native JavaScript libraries and React Components. It is really important to have a solid grip on how these technologies work to complement your understanding of HyperReact. Most searches for help on Google will take you to examples written in JSX or ES6 JavaScript but you will learn over time to transalte this to HyperReact equivalents. To make headway with HyperReact you do need a solid understanding of the underlying philosophy of React and its component based architecture. The 'Thinking in React' tutorial below is an excellent place to start. (Make sure you see the Flux pattern in HyperReact above for an example of how to communicate between grandparent and child components).

### Opal under the covers

HyperReact is a DSL wrapper of React which uses Opal to compile Ruby code to ES5 native JavaScript. If you have not used Opal before then you should at a minimum read the excellent guides as they will teach you enough Opal to get you started with HyperReact.
